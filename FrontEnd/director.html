                <p>If you ever need healthcare of any kind, we hope that you would make Suwa Shanthi Hospital your
                    first choice based on our reputation for excellent clinical services, our facilities and our
                    friendly Consultants and staff. We are your local private hospital in the heart of your community.<br>
                    <br>We have over 20 years of service provided by our excellent teams of Doctors, Nurses, and Healthcare Professionals staff.
                    We have shared and developed best practice and can offer a solution for almost every one of your healthcare needs.<br>

<br>As well as expert medical care we have invested in our facilities to bring you the surroundings and the care that will make your stay more 
comfortable and aid a fast recovery. We have recently committed to a huge investment in Suwa Shanthi Hospital which has already seen a larger,
more welcoming reception area, newly refurbished en-suite bedrooms and a newly designed and refurbished Physiotherapy Department. We will be
continuing this investment throughout the hospital over the coming year.<br>

<br>We have also invested in the last few years in new state of the art equipment and services. This includes upgrading all our x-ray equipment,
adding new operating theatre equipmentâ€™s and ward bedrooms. We are now better placed than ever to provide an outstanding service and to meet
the needs of our local residents.<br>

<br>We know that safety and cleanliness are key factors for you in the service you receive. We continually work with our infection control staff
to ensure that our infection rates are exceptionally lower. That is a real testament to our staff and the rigorous cleaning regimes we have
in place. All our staff are appropriately trained and continually updated so that you can be assured of an excellent clinical service based on current research. We are able to accept children and provide a specialist service of trained nurses and doctors.
<br><br>
Lastly, I look forward to welcoming you to Suwa Shanthi Hospital and should you wish an individual appointment to see me, I will be delighted
to meet you
